            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Giving an account whence the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has ſo much to ſay concerning the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> when the Scriptures and the Ancient Writers of the Church ſay ſo little of Her.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT Infallibility which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only challenges, and ſo much boaſts of, can ſignifie no leſs than this, That ſhe expects that all Chriſtians ſhould ſecurely commit, not only their <hi>Faith,</hi> but alſo their <hi>Devotions</hi> to be conducted by her. For it is not ſo neceſſary in Religion, to be inſtructed in all its Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and to believe aright, as it is duly to obey and ſerve God: nor is every wrong Opinion ſo dangerous, as falſe and miſtaken Worſhip. If a Phyſician ſhould proclaim himſelf for <hi>infallible,</hi> the reputation of his skill would quickly ſink, if he failed ordinarily in the <hi>Regiment of Health,</hi> and made more Diſtempers than he cured. And no wiſe Traveller would chuſe him for the Guide of his way, who though he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew every ſtep of it, yet was wont to lead thoſe whom he conducted, to repoſe themſelves under Trees of unhealthful ſhade and influence; and to bring them, for the quenching their thirſt, to thoſe Springs whoſe Waters were neither clear nor wholeſome. A learned perſon <note n="a" place="margin">Serarius in Litaneut. 2. Queſt. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> of this Church, is ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this truth, that he is fain to defend, that their <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> extends as far as to the <hi>Canonization of Saints;</hi> and that there can be no miſtake committed herein; for, ſays he, <q>If in this matter the Church can be deceived and deceive, the pillar and ground of Truth would totter and fall; the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96967:6"/>
Lord Chriſt would forſake his Spouſe; the Holy Ghoſt would not teach thoſe that are <hi>his</hi> all neceſſary Truth; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> would not in his Succeſſors feed the Flock of Chriſt with the neceſſary food of Religion; no nor <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Prince of Shepherds: For he to whom the Pope gives his Teſtimony, and pronounces, that he is authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be venerated with Religious Worſhip, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked with publick Prayers; if ſuch a one may prove to be no Saint, is it not plain, that a falſe Teſtimony is given, deadly poiſon, lying worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>

                  </note> not long ſince. That a great many of the Saints they venerate are Fabulous, and no evidence that ſuch were ever in being; ſome Canonized for Saints that were Boutefeus and Traytors, heady and high-minded, ſuch as <hi>ſpake evil of Dignities,</hi> and unjuſtly oppoſed the <hi>Powers ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God.</hi> The Reader will ſee falſe Miracles and falſe Tales advanced to give them reputation and credit; and, which is worſe ſtill, the Falſity ſo apparent, that thoſe who make uſe of them to abuſe the ſimple thereby, muſt needs, if they be but tolerably knowing in Hiſtory, be ſelf-condemned. In fine, he will ſee ſo clearly that the intereſts of the World, and not thoſe of true Piety, both makes many of their Saints and warms their Devotions to them, that he may well ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that in this Church <hi>Faith</hi> has not been well preſerved, when he ſees ſo little regard had to the keeping of a good Conſcience.

What Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath told us any thing of this?</hi> What Prophet has given leave to worſhip any Man; <hi>much leſs a Woman?</hi> The great ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Scripture in this matter is acknowledged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as we ſhall ſee by and by) and the Reader will meet with admirable Reaſons, why this Church is ſo copious in giving an account of her, when the Scripture ſays nothing of it. In the mean time, I cannot but mention a Complaint that <hi>Pet. Cluniacenſis</hi> once made (as <hi>Eſpencaeus</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">In 2. Ep. ad Timoth. c. 4. §. 21.</note> relates it) of the Service of St. <hi>Benet.</hi> 
                  <q>That among the falſe Canticles in the Church of God, and among the loud trifles that were odious to him, on the Feaſt of the great Father <hi>Benet,</hi> he heard a Hymn ſung, and was compelled to bear a part in it, in which Song he found at leaſt Four and twenty Lyes.</q> This Trade you ſee went pretty forward in this Church above Five hundred Years ago; but ſince that time it is vaſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, and in the caſe of the B. Virgin, above all other Saints, the fictions are far more numerous and bold; becauſe they bear proportion to that height to which their fancies have advanced her. This plain dealing our Adverſaries cannot bear, and no wonder, ſince nothing can more vex a Cheat, than to be diſcovered. All that have remarkably contributed to this, have been loaded with their Calumnies, alive or dead, no matter which. Thus they have told the World, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <hi>Yea rather bleſſed are they which hear the Word of God and keep it.</hi> As for other matters concerning her, where the Scriptures have not gone before us, we are contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the dark; concluding that we are not one way or other much concerned in them; for if we had, God would no doubt have declared them to us.

There are Sixty Queens, and Eighty Concubines, and Virgins without number: My Beloved, my undefiled is but one, the only one of her Mother, the choice one of her that bare her.</hi> 2. That ſhe was promiſed by Heaven to the Fathers, prefigured by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Miracles, foretold by Prophetick Oracles, and by the Sybils was honourably predicted. 3. That ſhe ſprang by the kindneſs of God from barren Parents, that vowed to give to God the Off-ſpring he ſhould beſtow on them; that an Angel foretold her Nativity to her Parents, which we do not read in the Scriptures concerning any other Woman,</q> 
                  <hi>(no nor of her neither there.)</hi> 
                  <q>4. That ſhe only of all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> that deſcended from him by the ordinary way of Propagation <hi>(per ſeminalem rationem)</hi> was free from Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin. 5. That in the very beginning of her immaculate Conception, ſhe was ſo confirmed in Grace, that ever after ſhe was without ſtain of actual, though but venial, Sin. 6. That the <hi>Fomes peccati,</hi> that which like Tinder ſo ſoon kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in us, was extinct in her; ſo that ſhe never was ſenſible of that Tyrannous Law of the Members, or the Rebellion of the lower Part. 7. That in her very Conception ſhe had the uſe of Reaſon, and made a Vow of Virginity to God; from which inſtant alſo ſhe began to merit, and that the merit of her Works was never interrupted, no not ſo much as in her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96967:9"/>
ſleep. 8. That in the ſame Conception of hers ſhe was adorned with all Theological and Cardinal Vertues; and that in that Heroick Degree, as well as with all the <hi>gratiae gratis datae,</hi> graces freely given. 9. That at the Age of Three Years ſhe was in the Temple, according to her Parents Vow, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and there was moſt holily Educated. 10. That this Bleſſed Perſon among Women, eſcaped all that Curſe to which mankind, by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, was obnoxious. 11. That ſhe alone, that had conceived without any luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaſure, did not undergo the Irkſomneſs that other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child are ſubject to. 12. That by a Virgin Birth ſhe brought forth God without pain. 13. That the Lord's Body exhibited in the H. Euchariſt, is formed of her Blood in her Virgin Womb, which therefore is compared, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. to a <hi>heap of Wheat ſet about with Lilies.</hi> 14. That ſhe in a ſingular manner did many ways co-operate to our Salvation. 15. That the Fruit of Chriſt's Paſſion was in a ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner communicated to her, and ſtanding courageouſly by the Croſs of her Son, was pierced through with the Sword of grief, and therefore ſhe firſt of all ſaw Chriſt when he aroſe from the Dead. 16. That ſhe was the Inſtructer and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of the Apoſtles and Teachers. 17. That her Body did not ſee Corruption; but being aſſumed and taken up to Heaven in Body and Soul before the common Reſurrection, ſhe was placed above the Choires of Angels and Orders of Saints, at the Right-hand of her Son, where ſhe makes a diſtinct Order <hi>(Chorus)</hi> above them all, and ſhe alone obtained more glory than all the reſt of the Saints and Angels put together. 18. That her preſence brought a great deal of accidental Joy to the Bleſſed in Heaven. 19. That ſhe is the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Lady</hi> of all the Angels and Saints. 20. That ſhe is the common Advocate of Sinners, the Mother of Mercy, the Mediatrix to intercede for them; and that ſhe is alſo the Mother of the Living, and promotes the Salvation of all Men. 21. That ſhe is ſo formidable and terrible to the Devils, that they preſently fly away at the mention of her Name, and much more at her Command; and that ſhe hath powerfully broken their Head. 22. That all the Graces and Privileges that are diſperſed among other Saints, are found united in her, after a far more perfect manner.</q> Thus

               <p>Theſe are a few Inſtances, among many, which will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards occurr, that give the Reader a taſte of the New Faith and Goſpel, concerning the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which is taught in this Church. With ſuch particulars as theſe, the Hymns, and Leſſons of their Breviaries are ſtuffed: For to eſtabliſh the believe of them, many of their Feſtivals are Inſtituted; and to the Scandal of Chriſtianity, as well as the eternal reproach of their Miſſions, <hi>Hierome Xaverius</hi> a Jeſuit, in the <hi>Hiſtory of Chriſt,</hi> which he publiſhed in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, <hi>Ar. Dom.</hi> 1602. being commanded to give an account of the Life and Actions of our Saviour by the <hi>Great Mogol;</hi> he, not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with an Impartial delivery of that Faith which the Apoſtles taught, and was once delivered to the Saints, has, together with the Goſpel Story, interwoven idle Tales, and fabulous Legends, derived from Goſſiping Tradition, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Books confeſſed by themſelves to be Apocryphal, and the Fictions of ancient Hereticks, eſpecially what refers to the Bl. Virgin; which I ſuppoſe he intended for this end, that all his Converts ſhould ſet her up for an Object of their Religious Veneration; otherwiſe that firſt Faith might have been ſufficient for them, which ſerved thoſe firſt Chriſtians, and made them wiſe to Salvation, who only worſhipped God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>From all that has been ſaid it cannot but appear, that this Church has made a very bold attempt, for which they muſt anſwer one day to God, among the, <gap reason="foreign">

               <argument>
                  <p>An account of the Currant Faith of the Roman Church concerning the B. Virgin, and of the Worſhip they pay to her ſuitable to that Belief. Beginning with her Predeſtination, to her Nativity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHatſoever I have aſſerted in the foregoing Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will appear more clearly in that Romantick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory this Church has given us of the B. Virgin's Life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhall ſee both what the Church believes concerning her; and after that, what Worſhip they pay to her, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Belief. And in doing this, I hope I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur any Readers cenſure, no not ſo much as of the Romaniſt for taking this Method, ſince they themſelves have given it me, in their own <hi>Offices</hi> upon the <hi>Feaſts</hi> that are appointed to her honour; wherein we find theſe two are interwoven, her <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and her <hi>Worſhip.</hi> To have ſet down only the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> her Worſhip, would have been to preſent a naked Image of ſtrange Devotion, enough to have frighted any Chriſtian. The flattery of her being ſo fulſome <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <q>She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>Contemplations of the Life and Glory of H.</hi> Mary, <hi>p.</hi> 18. As it is not poſſible for the Tongue of a Seraphim, to explain to our comprehenſion the Shapes and Liveries of the heavenly Spirits, their Quires and Hierarchies, to blazon the Glories of the Saints, and to expound the Plenty, Paſtimes and Language of the Divine Courtiers; ſo much rather is it impoſſible for a pure Creature to unfold the immenſe Attributes of the Maternity of Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> which gives to her an inherent right to all the perfections, ſo copiouſly by Providence diſperſed amongſt Creatures here beneath, the Stars in the Firmament, and the Angels in Heaven. <hi>Ibid.

                     <p>(Our Saviour ſpeaks of many who ſhall ſay to him <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and yet he would not know them; but it ſhould ſeem by this, if they had but known the ſecret of ſaying <hi>Lady, Lady,</hi> they would not have miſcarried.)</p>
                  </note>; that if there had been nothing ſaid to give a riſe to ſuch Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96967:13"/>
it could not eſcape the cenſure of extravagant Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; whereas the Hiſtory cloaths the Image with an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous dreſs, and gives ſome colour at leaſt to thoſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, while it repreſents her not only in her ſelf a ſubject of Excellencies and Perfections, far above thoſe of Men and Angels, and nearly bordering upon the Divinity; but alſo one, who in the Intention of God was deſigned to have a great Hand in the conducting us to Happineſs, a helper and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker with our Saviour himſelf in the work of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and thereby fairly challenging a great ſhare in our Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

               <p>To prepare us for what we may expect to hear of her, when they bring her upon the ſtage of the World, give me leave only to premiſe, how they conſider her in the Divine Decree, before ſhe was conceived and born into the World.</p>

                           <note n="q" place="margin">Novarinus ibid. p. 89. n. 296.</note> from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt Inſtant of her Conception, and never ceaſed to do ſo afterwards, never intermitted <hi>(as he explains it)</hi> the moſt fervent Act of Charity.</q> If he had ſaid this of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit that it never ceaſed, it might have better paſſed; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it of the Act, as he does, it is impoſſible to be true of any one that lives in Fleſh. But what we think impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſay no body need doubt of, as in this that follows, which concerns the meaſure of that Grace, ſhe had in the firſt moment again of her Conception; which we are told <note n="r" place="margin">Raynaudus, ibid. p. 159. &amp; Illeph. Giron in promptuar. conc p. 60.</note> was more copious and intenſe, than that which Angels and Men attain to in their Conſummation; which is admirably proved by that of the Pſalmiſt (Pſ. 87.) <hi>The Lord loveth the Gates of Sion</hi> 
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Spinellus, ib. c. 7. p. 115.</note>, that is, the Conception of the Virgin, <hi>more than all the Dwellings of Jacob;</hi> that is, more than other Saints.</p>
                     <p>The Reader, I dare ſay, by this time, is paſt all Hopes of gueſſing, to what Pitch his Faith is to be ſcrew'd up, in matters that concern the Bleſſed Virgin. When I met with a Jeſuit <note n="t" place="margin">Sherlog Anteloq. 8. in Cantic. Sec. 1.</note> aſſerting, <hi>That the oldeſt Saint in this Life, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96967:27"/>
attained ſo great a Meaſure of Grace, as was infuſed into her when ſhe firſt began to live,</hi> I was ready to think that he would make a bold Attempt that would carry the Matter higher: For though another <note n="u" place="margin">Max. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus in Luna myſtic. p. 52.</note> indeed was ſo great a Lunatick, as to call her, <hi>Antiqua dierum,</hi> the <hi>Ancient of Days,</hi> a Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> to God himſelf; yet his Reaſon for it was but the ſame; <q>Becauſe ſhe in her Mother's Womb was filled with Wiſdom, Prudence, Underſtanding, and the reſt of the Gifts of the Divine Spirit, above all the moſt aged.</q> But to tell us, that then her Grace exceeded the Meaſures of Angels and of Saints conſummate in Bliſs, is ſuch wild Divinity, as one would ſcarce look to meet with any where, unleſs from him that for half an Hour together cries <hi>Glory, Glory</hi> in <hi>Bethlem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One would wonder whence this Fancy concerning her, of reaſoning in her Mother's Womb, and having ſuch Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations there, ſhoald ariſe. The only acknowledged Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is, That many Authors <note n="x" place="margin">

                     <p>Another Reaſon they reſerve as a Secret, though I doubt not but it is intended in all theſe Aſſertions, <hi>viz.</hi> The making her in every thing that is poſſible like unto Chriſt himſelf; that ſo, when their Lines run ſo parallel, they may the more plauſibly call her, a <hi>Helper,</hi> a <hi>Co-worker,</hi> a <hi>Co-redeemer,</hi> or what ever other Name they uſe, to ſignify how much we are engaged to her in promoting our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>This therefore being the common Opinion of the School-men, (as <hi>Eſtius</hi>

Fathers concerning the Bleſſed Virgins Preſervation from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin, ſince none of them ſo much as mention it: Though in his time it appears, by his 174 Epiſtle to the Canons of</hi> Lyons, <hi>there was ſome Debate about it among Divines.</hi> I ſhall make bold to add, that this Controverſy betwixt the Two Parties (they who aſſert her Conception in Original Sin, whom we ſhall call (to avoid Circumlocution) <hi>Maculiſts,</hi> and thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it the <hi>Immaculiſts)</hi> is not only Late and Novel, but alſo extreamly fooliſh and ridiculous, when you conſider where the Difference lies betwixt them. They themſelves confeſs <note n="b" place="margin">Vaſquez ibid. qu. 27. diſp. 114. c. 1. &amp; Bellarm. de amiſſ. gratiae, l. 4. c. 15.</note> that it is agreed on all Hands in their Church, that ſhe was ſanctified in her Mothers Womb before ſhe was born; ſo that the only Queſtion (and it is a very wiſe one) is, <hi>Whether in the firſt Moment of her Conception</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Th. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naudus Dipt. Mar. p 132.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhe was immaculate, yea or no?</hi> Both Parties agreeing, that ſhe had the Uſe of her Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as we heard before) in the firſt Moment of her Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one might have been tempted to think, conſidering the Zeal of the oppoſite Side, that the <hi>Maculiſts</hi> had brought her in loaded and labouring for ſome Months together in her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, under a ſenſe of Gods heavy Diſpleaſure for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, which the other ſide could not endure to ſuppoſe, and that this made them ſo very angry. But there is no ſuch matter I aſſure you; they are as civil to the Bleſſed Virgin in this Reſpect as one can poſſibly deſire. For one of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries <note n="d" place="margin">Franciſcus a Chriſto. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. de Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. fol. 189.</note> has given us an account of Three Opinions among them, and all of them very favourable to her. The Severeſt is that of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> 
                        <q>who thinks that ſhe was in Sin for a time (but ſo ſhort a time that none can meaſure it) to wit, ſo much time as intervenes between two Moments <hi>(inter duo inſtantia;)</hi> for in the firſt Inſtant of her Conception, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Original Stain; in the next Moment after it, ſhe was purged from it; ſo that ſhe was obnoxious to Sin only the time that muſt come between thoſe Two Moments. Others think that the Bleſſed Virgin was a whole Moment of Time in Sin <hi>(integro temporis inſtanti,)</hi> but all the time that is coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that Inſtant, was in Grace, and ſo grant that her Son delivered his Mother from Guilt, as ſoon as it was poſſible for Divine Omnipotency to effect it.</q> This will not pleaſe the <hi>Immaculiſts;</hi> for this Reaſon, becauſe if they ſay that the firſt Inſtant ſhe was in Sin, tho they grant that in the next
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96967:34"/>
Inſtant Grace was infuſed to take it away; yet becauſe two Inſtants (according to the Philoſopher, 6 <hi>Phyſic.)</hi> cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cohere (no more than Two Atoms in continued Quantity) without a middle Time between them, therefore the Bleſſed Virgin muſt be in Sin according to this Opinion, not only the firſt Inſtant, but alſo the time between that and the ſecond. But he ſays there are a third Sort (and they are the very Pinks of Courteſy) who come thus far as to ſay, <q>That in the firſt Inſtant in which ſhe contracted Guilt, ſhe was alſo delivered from the ſame by God: Only they crave Leave to divide an Inſtant into Three <hi>(in tria Signa):</hi> In the firſt of which ſhe contracted Sin; in the ſecond ſanctifying Grace was infuſed into her Soul, but more incompleat and tranſient, abiding with Sin, but ready to expel it: In the third the ſame Grace is underſtood as permanent, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to have expelled Sin.</q> This indeed is too ſubtil to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, yet however one would think, it ſhould be kindly taken by thoſe of the other Opinion; ſince, if they will but allow them the third Part of a Moment for her ſtay under the Original Guilt, they then declare her to be as immaculate as the other can imagine her to be: And if the one Party appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends a Wound to be given to the Honour of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by the Suppoſition of her being under that Sin, it is healed, you ſee, by the other in far leſs time, than the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye, or the quickneſs of the ſwifteſt Thought. And yet after all, I aſſure you, it is morally certain that theſe Two Parties will never be pieced together, but eternally quarrel. Freſh Combatants appear every day upon the Stage, and they charge one another ſo furiouſly, and engage the People in ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Quarrel, that neither <hi>General Council</hi> nor <hi>Pope</hi> (whom both ſides acknowledge only capable of doing it) dare decide this doughty Matter, for fear of worſe Conſequences to enſue thereupon. So that all things conſidered, never was a juſter Cenſure, than that ſevere one, which a <hi>Poet</hi> of their own <note n="e" place="margin">Mantuan. in S. Feſt.

The whole Stream of Antiquity running ſo clearly in the former Chanel, and the Scriptures alſo ſo plainly making way for it; it cannot well be thought, that any one Man ſhould boldly undertake to ſtem this Tide.

4. That no Blot may be left unhit; a Jeſuit <note n="p" place="margin">Greg. de Valentia, ib.</note> conceives he has ſpied a weak place, an eaſineſs and tenderneſs of Nature in his Adverſaries, in Matters that concern the Honour of the Bleſſed Virgin, and he reſolves to work upon it. He tells them, That though their Opinion be not <hi>heretical,</hi> nor contains <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin</hi> in the holding of it; yet it gives juſt Occaſion of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Bleſſed Virgin, ſo that they may well expect ſhe ſhould be leſs favourable and propitious to them, which, ſays he, they ought extreamly to dread. Now that ſo it is, is plain by this Inſtance: Suppoſe a Controverſy depended before a Judge concerning the Nobility of a Perſon, which though the Judge did not abſolutely define, yet if he declared that it was very probable that he was a noble Perſon, and he ſhould take it more kindly, if he were accounted and treated as ſuch; would it not be ſufficient Cauſe of Diſtaſt, if he to whom the Judge had been ſo favourable, could not obtain that Honour which is ſo encouraged? This is the Bleſſed Virgins Caſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly; every one has Liberty given him by the Church to think thus honourably of her; and the Church has encouraged the paying of it, by ſpiritual Indulgences; and has not the Bleſſed Virgin reaſon then to be ſomewhat diſpleaſed and angry with thoſe that ſtill deny it?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I ſhall add but one Argument more, which another Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit <note n="q" place="margin">Raynaudus Diptyc.

If ſhe did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert ſuch a perfect Act of Love to God, it is plain by that Act ſanctifying Grace was conveyed. Therefore ſhe was freed from original Sin.

                        <q>For, among other things, he aſſerts, that the Argument from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is weak and infirm: That the ſtrength and efficacy of the Reaſons he has urged is to be preferred before it: That God does not reveal all Truths to all, but every Age glories in its proper Verities, which the former Age was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with</q> (which he would never have mentioned, if he had not known this to be a Novelty) <q>that the Doctors the younger they are, they are ſo much the more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted</q>.

A Man might ſwear that he is not urging <hi>us</hi> with this Argument of Miracles, but intends this as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>ſomewhere elſe,</hi> as the Words following do inform us: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if it were ſo, then it muſt be granted that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition affirming the Bleſſed Virgin's Conception to have been Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, has the Certainty of Faith for it, which it's plain cannot be yet affirmed, becauſe of the Silence of the Church</hi> (that is, with a Jeſuit, of the Pope) <hi>in this matter.</hi> And he adds, <hi>That he does very piouſly, who from hence gives a firm Aſſent to it,</hi> ſed infra certitudinem divinae fidei, <hi>but ſhort of the Certainty of Divine Faith.</hi> Thoſe Words then of <hi>pious Aſſent</hi> and <hi>prudential Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and ſuch like, are Tricks and only Words of Courſe; for one <hi>of the Church</hi> may believe in this Caſe either way, and has free Leave to do it, without being condemned: So that God may do what Miracles he pleaſes on one ſide, and yet a Man may ſafely be on the other ſide, till the <hi>Pope</hi> contradicts it: So that it is <hi>He</hi> plainly that can only oblige him to believe to Purpoſe. Which gives me occaſion to reflect upon a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond good Uſe that the former Conſiderations of Miracles and Revelations will afford us, <hi>viz.</hi> A plain Diſcovery of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiveneſs of their unerring Guide, infallible Judge, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of Controverſies in ſome Caſes.

I doubt the Anſwer could not be returned ſo eaſily, <hi>I know thou believeſt.</hi> He is not ſo quickly underſtood I aſſure you, nor his Mind ſo eaſily known: He has often put on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faces, and by his various Appearances given Occaſion to complain, <hi>Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo?</hi> Yet me-thinks we have ſome good hold of him, and ſhall not eaſily let it go.

                     <p>For either the Pope believes thoſe Miracles, Viſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations for the Proof of the immaculate Conception (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in thoſe) or he does not. If he does not believe them, ſurely we are fairly excuſed from being concerned about them, ſince he has greater Opportunities than we can have, to find out their Cheat if they be forged; and if they were true, his Faith ſhould be the forwardeſt: But if he does believe them, then the Matter is worſe, conſidering the Place he ſits in; for he pretends to be the unerring Guide (as I ſaid) of Faith, the Judge and Determiner of Controverſies. It is boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Privilege of his Church, that its Differences can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be endleſs (though thoſe of other Churches may) for here is one appointed to decide them, and his Deciſion liable to no Miſtake. Very good: And why is not this Controverſy then determined? It has been a Controverſy in his Church of Four hundred Years ſtanding, and yet every Judge in Succeſſion that has ſate in this Chair has been dumb, and his Infallibility lain by, and no Body has been the better for it. It cannot be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his behalf, That the thing is not weighty enough to be determined, and to become an Article of Catholick Faith; for whatſoever <hi>we</hi> may think of it, yet he dares not own that <hi>he</hi> thinks ſo, when it is about a glorious Privilege of the Bleſſed Virgin; and when he is now ſuppoſed to believe the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Miracles to be Divine that do atteſt it; for God ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does not uſe to interpoſe in that manner about Trifles. He cannot be excuſed neither for hiding this precious Talent of his, and not employing it for want of a ſufficient Call thereto: For beſides that loud one of Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he is quick enough of hearing when he has a mind to canonize a Saint, or inſtitute a Feſtival; he has been loudly ſummoned to exerciſe his judging Faculty, by the Crys and Beſeechings of all ſorts both high and low, to pity the divided Church and heal its Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to becalm the boyſterous Tempeſt, that has threatned to ſink the Ship of the Church, by one powerful Word of his; but all in vain: He lies as one in a dead Sleep, and nothing can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken him.

                  <p>Upon occaſion of what I ſaid laſt, how the <hi>Pope</hi> has been loudly importun'd, to put an End to Controverſies, I cannot well paſs over that famous Hiſtory of the Embaſſy from <hi>Philip</hi> III. and IV. Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. for deciding this Controverſy about the Conception of the Virgin, which is given us by <hi>Luc. Wadding,</hi> a Franciſcan <note n="a" place="margin">Legatio Philippi 3. &amp; Ph. 4. ad paul. 5. &amp; Greg. 15. Lovan. 1624. per Luc. Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingum.</note>, out of whom I ſhall give the ſumm of it.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning almoſt of his Story he acknowledges that though heretofore the <hi>Maculiſts</hi> might freely and without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence have declared their Opinion; yet now adays the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> Opinion has-ſo poſſeſſed Mens Minds, that neither the Rabble nor the ſober People, the noted Doctors or grave Biſhops can endure to hear it. This Devotion to the Virgin, he ſays, prevailed wonderfully in <hi>Spain</hi> about Eight Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was chiefly excited by one <hi>Francis à ſan Jago,</hi> a Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan, who was fore-admoniſhed by the Bleſſed Virgin of <hi>Guadalupa</hi> (a Place in <hi>Spain,</hi> where ſhe has a famous Image) of the Increaſe of the Veneration and Worſhip of her imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Conception within a few Years, though not without Contradiction and Tumult; and for a Sign of the Truth of this, ſhe beſtowed upon him a Ring. Upon this he became a <note place="margin">P. 4.</note> zealous Promoter of this Myſtery, and the People, eſpecially of <hi>Boetica,</hi> applauded it, ſetting up Trophies of the Virgin's Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over original Sin, cauſing this Inſcription to be fixed on the Corners of Streets, High-ways, and on the Fronts of Churches, Mary <hi>was conceived without original Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Maculists</hi> were not idle in promoting their own, <note place="margin">P. 6.</note> and oppoſing and expoſing the received and common Doctrine; calling it heterodox and abominable, reviling thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from them, and following them with unſufferable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; who being thus provoked prepare Revenge and War;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96967:45"/>
ſo that with this Diſſention all <hi>Spain</hi> was on a Flame, which occaſioned Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. to ſend forth his Apoſtolick Letters, <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> dated <hi>July</hi> 6. 1616. wherein he renewed the Conſtitution of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. <q>which forbad the condemning the Opinion of the immaculate Conception for Hereſy, as alſo the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> V. had done, prohibiting any to preach about this Controverſy before a promiſcuous Multitude, or to write concerning it in the vulgar Tongue either way: Although permitting learned Men in publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of the Univerſities, and of general or provincial Chapters, where they were preſent that could underſtand the Matter, and no occaſion of Scandal likely to be given, to diſcuſs that Queſtion, and by Arguments to aſſert or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe either Part, ſo that neither were aſſerted to be Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Threatning Penalties againſt the Tranſgreſſors, till the Controverſy were decided by the Pope.</q> After this the Catholick King, moved by the Complaints of the People, conſults with the Pope's Legate and other learned Prelates, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Conſtitutions of the Pope did ſufficiently extinguiſh this Flame; who gave in their Judgment in the Negative.</p>
                  <p>The Catholick King reſolves therefore to petition the Pope for a more effectual Remedy, and ſends <hi>Placidus de Toſantes,</hi> ſometimes <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> with Two others, to <hi>Rome</hi> about it. Theſe obtained this Decree of the <hi>Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> confirmed by his Holineſs <hi>Aug.</hi> 31. 1617. <q>That the <note place="margin">P. 14.</note> Opinion of the <hi>Maculiſts,</hi> which occaſioned ſo much Scandal, Strife and Diſſention among Chriſtian People, ſhould, in no wiſe, be any longer aſſerted in publick Sermons, Lectures, Concluſions, or any other publick Acts, affirming that the Bleſſed Virgin was conceived in original Sin: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was ſtrictly and ſeverely cautioned alſo, That their Opinion ſhould not be impugned by others, no, nor ſo much as named or mentioned in the aforeſaid publick Acts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Holineſs did not intend hereby to reprobate that Opinion, or to do it any Prejudice, but left it in the ſame State and Terms that he found it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was received with great Joy in <hi>Spain</hi> by the People, who favoured the immaculate Conception; they feaſted and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained themſelves with Plays and Shows, judging that their Buſineſs was ſufficiently done. But others that were wiſer fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96967:46"/>
the contrary, and that it would give Occaſion to greater Scandals: And ſo it proved; for the <hi>Maculiſts</hi> raiſed new Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and the Diſorders were increaſed, and both Parties broke out into cruel and railing Invectives againſt each other. The King therefore, by the Advice of his Council, determined to ſend a new Embaſſy to the Pope, to move him that he would command the <hi>Maculiſts</hi> wholly to be ſilent, till he had decided the Controverſy. Whilſt he was preparing and conſulting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> the Perſon that ſhould carry this Embaſſy, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Letter from the Pope, wherein he deſires him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear urging him farther for a Deciſion of the Controverſy, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing with his own hand, That he had done what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in the laſt Decree, and all that he could do <hi>(totum quod potuit)</hi> in this matter.</p>
                  <p>The King thereupon thinking to deſiſt, he is ſo alarm'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh with the News of Tumults from divers Cities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that he reſolved upon a new Embaſſy, and chuſes for it <hi>Antonius de Treio,</hi> ſometimes General of the Franciſcans, whom he choſe to be Biſhop of <hi>Soſa,</hi> who came with the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Rome,</hi> dated 24 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1618. Together with which he <note place="margin">P. 30.</note> delivered ſeveral other Pacquets of the ſame Import with the Kings, ſolliciting the Deciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> A Pacquet from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal;</hi> another of <hi>Spain;</hi> Letters of the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Toletum</hi> and his ſuffragan Biſhops; Letters of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Compoſtella</hi> and his Suffragans: Another Bundle of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from all the Univerſities of <hi>Spain;</hi> another from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Confeſſors to the King and Prince, and other learned Doctors of the Order of the Predicants; with other Three Bundles of Letters from the Praefects and Provincials of all the Orders except one. To all which the Pope, after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Piety of the King, and the Devotion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to the Bleſſed Virgin, anſwered, <hi>That he could do no more</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>than he had done in this Controverſy, and that the Matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more mature Conſideration than he could afford it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the ſame Day he viſited and delivered the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſeveral Cardinals and Embaſſadors of Princes, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the King's Deſires, and begging their Aſſiſtance in this Matter, that concerned the Honour of the Bleſſed Virgin: And gave an Account of all to his Maſter in a Letter dated <hi>Decemb.</hi> 23. 1618. Wherein he informs him what he had done, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96967:46"/>
the Difficulties of the Affair; telling him, among other things, that the Pope's Anſwer was, That <hi>God had not yet inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>nor his Conſcience as yet dictated any thing to him, beſides that which was before commanded in his late Decree, and then was asked on his Majeſty's Behalf.</hi> The Embaſſador could do no more that Month, becauſe of the approaching Feaſt of the Nativity of our Lord. After the Feſtival was over the Embaſſador offers to the Pope an Oration, containing an humble Petition and a ſad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> againſt the Actions and Interpretations of the <hi>Maculiſts,</hi> who wreſted the laſt Decree, and made it to favour themſelves. He complained alſo, That ſince the Decree they taught their Opinion more eagerly, that no body offered to repreſs their Exceſſes, that in Desks and Pulpits they detracted from the Credit of their Adverſaries, calling them Ignorant, Ideots, Simple, Fools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He repreſented the Scandals alſo that muſt needs ariſe from the different Obſervations of her Feaſt, whilſt <note place="margin">P. 51.</note> inſtead of celebrating her <hi>Conception without Sin,</hi> ſome cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated her <hi>Sanctification from Sin.</hi> To all this, and more, which the Embaſſador urged, the Pope, after he had commended the pious Affection of the King, told him, by way of Anſwer, That Popes could not always ſatisfy the Deſires of Kings and <note place="margin">P. 54.</note> Princes, eſpecially in thoſe things which are determined <hi>not by an humane, but by a divine Sentence,</hi> ſuch as require not Man's Judgment, <hi>but the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, and an inward Impulſe;</hi> and the Spirit breathes when and where it liſteth: (By which Anſwer we may perceive, what Opinion the Pope would have the People have of his Determinations.) The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador alſo offered an Apology for his Maſter, whom ſome had reflected upon as too buſy about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, as <note place="margin">P. 56.</note> if he would conſtrain the Pope againſt his Mind: He offered alſo a Second Oration to the Pope, in which he complained <note place="margin">P. 79.</note> of the Scandals in <hi>Spain,</hi> and repreſented the Advantages of a Definition, and concluded with this Speech to the Pope. <hi>Conſider the Loſs of many Souls, the Diſcord of the Church, the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 89.</note> 
                     <hi>Diſſentions of Cities, and the great Dangers that hang over King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, all which you only are able to obviate and prevent.</hi> The Pope ſtill perſiſted in his Denial, that he could not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Controverſy. In the Interim the King gives his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador notice of the Continuation of the Scandals, and ſent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96967:47"/>
him Three Sermons, preached at <hi>Madrid</hi> and elſewhere, in which the Adverſaries urged their Opinion, after the Decree. He complained alſo of the Theſes maintained at <hi>Doway,</hi> and of <note place="margin">P. 91.</note> a Book of <hi>Fr. Sylvius,</hi> in which he diſputes againſt the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Conception. The Pope anſwered, That theſe Abuſes ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>After this the Embaſſador gave in a Third Paper, wherein <note place="margin">P. 92.</note> he ſets forth the weightineſs of the Matter, and after he had given large Encomiums of the Virgin out of divers Authors, he complained that her Sanctity was called in Queſtion, and the Controverſy managed irreligiouſly and irreverently; and one declared, that ſhe was conceived juſt as other Women, and that <hi>Mary's</hi> Conception was not more pure than that of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> He added, it was a vain thing to diſſemble the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and not to take away the Cauſe of it, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would end in Contempt of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Grief and Horror of the People, and a Decay of Devotion towards the Mother of God.</p>
                  <p>He repreſented what Advantage the Hereticks made of theſe <note place="margin">P. 103.</note> Contentions, to deride the Unity of the Church ſo much boaſted of. He ſaid it was horrible, That while <hi>the Prieſts offered the Body of Chriſt in honour of the immaculate Conception,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 106.</note> there ſhould be found thoſe among themſelves, that ſhould deride and inſult, ſaying, That it was to be rejected, and that all was Figments and Chimaera's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the Concluſion of his Oration, among other things, he urged the Pope withal <note place="margin">P. 113.</note> to make a Deciſion, he mentioned this, That hereby the Truth of thoſe many Miracles wrought by God and the Saints in teſtimony of the immaculate Conception, would be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and the Certainty of many Revelations confirmed. <hi>(Which was well urged, ſince any one would think they themſelves did not give Credit to what they would have us believe, when the Pope knows not what to ſay to the Matter after all.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope replyed, That he ſtood well affected to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception, but intimated that his Definition would not remove the Diſturbances, ſince the <hi>Maculiſts</hi> inſiſted, That <note place="margin">P. 116.</note> theirs was <hi>the unanimous Doctrine of all the Fathers,</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular produced the Teſtimonies for it of S. <hi>Auſtin, Lumbard</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure.</hi> The Embaſſad or underſtanding that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries had collected the Sentences of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96967:47"/>
them to the Pope, he put in a Fourth Paper, wherein he ſhewed, that the Authority of the holy Fathers indeed was great, eſpecially in eſtabliſhing weak Opinions; but to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit it was dangerous: That the Doctors were falſly cited by the Adverſaries, and Three only truly. That every Doctor might erre, which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſes of himſelf, and if S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> had lived now, he would have been of another Mind; and he concluded, <hi>That there was none after the Apoſtles who were not Popes that might not erre:</hi> And then turning to the Pope, <hi>In</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 129.</note> 
                     <hi>thee alone, and the Biſhops in thy Chair, no Error has Place, in thee Truth is eſtabliſhed, and in thy Seat has ſet up her venerable and perpetual Throne; from that Throne no Lye can ever ariſe.</hi> After he had thus flattered the Pope, he obtained of him a Book of <hi>P. de Vincentia</hi> a Dominican, in which the Sayings of the Fathers were collected for the <hi>Maculiſt</hi>'s Opinion, which were taken out of Two Books of <hi>Vinc. Bandellus,</hi> which fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed the immaculate Conception. And the Orator en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in a Fifth Paper to ſhow, that theſe Books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch things as were condemned by the Bull of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. Particularly he gave in the Heads of <hi>Bandellus</hi> his Books, which contained the ſevereſt Charges againſt the Opinion of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculiſts;</hi> as that it was a mortal Error, full of Falſity, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Pernicious; that it was injurious to the Blood of Chriſt, making her neither to be reconciled nor juſtified by it; that an Opinion founded in the holy Scriptures, was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Determinations of Pope and Council; That the <hi>Immaculiſts</hi> did contradict Scripture, and perniciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved them, and defended the Hereſy of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in their Expoſitions: He affirms, That the Perſons to <note place="margin">P. 134.</note> whom <hi>Revelations</hi> are ſaid to be made, concerning the Virgin's immaculate Conception, were ſuſpected Perſons, addicted to carnal Vices, and diſcovering that they had nothing of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in them: That the Miracles brought to confirm it, were <note place="margin">P. 140.</note> wrought by the Devil, who, by God's Permiſſion, healed ſome Infirmities upon invoking the immaculate Conception; that ſo he that was Filthy might be Filthy ſtill. After many ſuch Charges (which may be ſeen in the Hiſtory) he produced the Teſtimonies of Two hundred and ſixty famous Doctors who were againſt it: This Work of <hi>Bandelis,</hi> which was in many Hands that made ill uſe of it, the Embaſſador urged, that it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96967:48"/>
might by an Edict be put among the Catalogue of prohibited Books. But the Pope made anſwer, That the Conſtitution of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. (which begins <hi>Grave nimis, &amp;c.)</hi> was ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>After this the Embaſſador put in a Sixth Paper, to prove, <note place="margin">P. 149.</note> that the Difference of the Adverſaries in celebrating the Feaſt of the Conception, was not to be tolerated, and that it was fit they ſhould be commanded to celebrate it unanimouſly with the univerſal Church. The Pope returned that he had often dealt about it, and deſired that this Myſtery might be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated by all; but it was always anſwered by the <hi>Macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> That they did the ſame with others under the Name of <hi>Her Sanctification</hi> (not Conception) which comprehended all. Whereupon in a Seventh Speech, the Orator endeavoured to <note place="margin">P. 172.</note> ſhow, That the Catholick Church in the Feaſt of the Bleſſed Virgin's Conception, did now, and always, intend nothing elſe thereby, than to celebrate her Preſervation from original Sin, ſo that in no Inſtant ſhe was actually ſubject to it. The Pope ſaid he did not doubt of this, that the Church intended by their Worſhip of the Conception to profeſs that <hi>Mary</hi> was preſerved from original Sin; but it was better in this turbulent and calamitous State of the Empire, to ſtudy and endeavour Peace at Home, than by innovating to beget inteſtine Broils. Notwithſtanding this Anſwer, the Embaſſador offered an Eighth <note place="margin">P. 201.</note> Paper, to ſhow how great the Inequality was between the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; and that an Opinion which at one time was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at another time might become altogether Improbable; That Truths do not appear all at one time, but ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for every Age: That many things accounted dubious by the Ancients, are now look'd upon as certain and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; ſuch as the Validity of the Baptiſm of Hereticks; the ſeeing the divine Eſſence before the Day of Judgment; That Angels are incorporeal; and that Souls are immediately cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by God, and ſuch like: Which he applied to this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Conception, which, though it was not ſo clear in the Ages before, yet after the Appearance of <hi>Scotus</hi> (about the Year 1300.) who opened the Controverſy with all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs, the <hi>Maculiſt</hi>'s Opinion did decline, and the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ever after got Ground of it: After this he endeavoured to prove his own Opinion about the immaculate Conception, by various Reaſons, too large to be repeated. The Pope made
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96967:48"/>
Anſwer, That he acknowledged the great Probability of the <note place="margin">P. 234.</note> 
                     <hi>Immaculiſt</hi>'s Opinion, and that its State and Terms were better; but the Adverſaries ſtill maintained, That theirs ſtill kept its Place, and had not loſt all Probability, nor that the <hi>pious Opinion</hi> was ſo undoubted and irrefragable, that for its Sake the Contrary ſhould be exploded: Nay they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, That if it ſhould come to a Definition (which ſome ſay is impoſſible) that the Sentence muſt needs go on their Side, becauſe of the Authority of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Doctors,</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas;</hi> nor that it could, at leaſt ought not, be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for the <hi>Pious one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Embaſſador not being yet ſatisfied, he adds a Ninth Treatiſe, to prove that the Controverſy concerning the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <note place="margin">P. 236.</note> 
                     <hi>Mary</hi>'s Conception might be ended by a definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Church, and that no other Sentence, but for her immaculate Conception, could be propounded by the Church with certainty of Faith; and gave many Reaſons to ſhew the Expediency of doing it as ſoon as might be. The Pope reply'd, That there was no need of Arguments to prove that the Controverſy was capable of Deciſion; he <note place="margin">P. 289.</note> knew well how much he was able to do in it; neither did he doubt of his Power, but of the Conveniency and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of defining it; That this was by no means a fit Seaſon for the Examination and exact Determination of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Thus things ſtood whilſt this Embaſſador managed them: But, when by reaſon of this Delay of the Pope in defining <note place="margin">P. 291.</note> (to which he could not be brought by all theſe repeated Urgings) the Differences in <hi>Spain</hi> increaſed daily; the King choſe a more illuſtrious Embaſſador, the Duke <hi>Abuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quius,</hi> and ſent him to <hi>Rome.</hi> Where the firſt thing he met with was a Complaint, That the Maſter of the Sacred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, had prohibited the making any more <hi>Medals of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> and confiſcated thoſe which he found made. Theſe <note place="margin">P. 295.</note> Medals had been coined for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and on one ſide had the Image of the Body of Chriſt and of the Chalice, with this Inſcription, <hi>Alabado ſia el ſantiſſimo Sacramento:</hi> That is, <hi>Let the moſt holy Sacrament be praiſed.</hi> On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide was an Hieroglyphick Image of the immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96967:49"/>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>This is explained among the Indulgences, at the end of the holy Bull of the Cruſado, granted by</hi> Gregory XIII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

He referred the Matter to <hi>Cardinal Cobellutius,</hi> who, after a few Days, told them, That he thought their Deſire would be granted together with Indulgences, if theſe Words <hi>piè creditur (it is piouſly believed)</hi> were adjoined to the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <note place="margin">P. 306.</note> to prevent the Miſtake of the People, and the Fear of the Adverſaries, that it might not be thought that the Matter was defined for the <hi>Immaculiſts,</hi> and the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion exploded. This the Embaſſador upon Deliberation would not conſent to, but inſiſted, that in Favour of the Dutcheſs the Medals might be allowed without Exception: But nothing was further done in it.</p>
                  <p>The former Embaſſador having received Letters from the <note place="margin">P. 335.</note> King for his Return, before he departed he preſented two or three Tractates to the Pope. The one was about Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially thoſe of S. <hi>Briget,</hi> which he defended againſt the Adverſaries, and endeavoured to leſſen the Authority of thoſe of S. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Sena:</hi> And then applied himſelf to the Pope, exhorting him to make an End of the Difference; urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the Definitions of other Popes, which rely'd upon Revelations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Inſtance, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> I. defined the Controverſy on what Day <hi>Eaſter</hi> was to be kept, moved by a Revelation made to <hi>Friar Hermes: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> IV. inſtituted the Feſtival of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Day, upon an Inſtinct and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made to a certain Woman: Who alſo decreed <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit to be a Saint, and to be invocated, only becauſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> the Abbot reported (as S. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſays) that he ſaw his Soul fly up to Heaven, and his Sanctity was revealed to him.

                  <p>Another Paper he put in, to ſhow that the Pope was <hi>bound by his Office,</hi> to provide a timely Remedy for theſe great and <note place="margin">P. 375.</note> growing Scandals, ariſing from the Liberty of opining in this Controverſy of the Bleſſed Virgin's Conception, and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating the <hi>Maculiſt</hi>'s Opinion. In which he ſhewed, out of approved Authors and authentick proceedings of Courts, how theſe Scandals had been notorious and continued, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that had been yet done to hinder them, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and eſpecially in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> in all Places of it; which Scandals he proved to continue ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Decree, ſo that there was no Remedy remaining but that of a Peremptory Definition.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtory further tells us, That in <hi>Spain</hi> the Scandals ſtill increaſing, and Cities and People being divided into Factions, ſome Academies, and rich Cities, and whole Kingdoms did bind themſelves by Oaths and Vows, to defend the Opinion of the immaculate Conception; and we are told by others <note n="b" place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>After all this Stir and doing nothing; the former Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor took his Leave of the Pope; who told him that he was ſorry that he could not ſatisfy the Kings pious Wiſhes in this Matter: <hi>But,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>that which was deſired, was not of that ſort of things, which is within the Limits of humane Diligence, or</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>When this Embaſſador was gone, <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> upon whom the whole Care of this Affair was devolved, inſiſts upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and receives the ſame delatory Anſwers from Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. who, upon the fourth Calends of <hi>February</hi> 1621. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <note place="margin">P. 431.</note> this Life, and was ſucceeded by <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. to whom this Duke applies himſelf in the Name of his Maſter; who commending, as his Predeceſſor had done, the Piety of the King, told him, he would comply with him, when time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Things, after a foregoing grave Examination of the Matter, would give him leave.</p>
                  <p>But preſently after <hi>Philip</hi> III. of <hi>Spain</hi> dies, and choſe to do it in the Habit of a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> and left the care of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> IV. his Succeſſor, who confirmed <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>About this time, not only the old Conteſts and Scandals which troubled <hi>Spain,</hi> but a new Occaſion of an extraordinary Embaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> made the King to ply the former Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He writes therefore to <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> to urge the Buſineſs, and give the Letter to the Pope which he ſent.

The Embaſſador had a Hearing, and a general Anſwer of good Hope was given him, That the Pope thought of nothing now, but to remove thoſe Scandals that continued, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A while after a new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>(Comes Montis Regij)</hi> arrives at <hi>Rome:</hi> He was ſent thither to aſſiſt at the Canonization of Five new Saints (Four of which were <hi>Spaniards) Iſadore</hi> of <hi>Madrid, Ignatius Loyola, Fran. Xaverius, Tereſia à Jeſu;</hi> and one <hi>Italian, Philip Nereus.</hi> This <hi>Count</hi> was brought in to the Pope in great State and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifice, <note place="margin">P. 443.</note> and begged in Favour to him, that the Pope would put his laſt Hand to this Buſineſs; who promiſed that ſomething ſhould be done in it before his Departure. And in order to it ſeveral Cardinals were appointed, to whom their Deſires ſhould be propoſed. Two things they offered to them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was more deſirable that the Controverſy might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If by the ſtraitneſs of Time that could not be done, then in the Interim, that whatſoever did ſeem to contradict the immaculate Conception, might be removed and

baniſhed from Diſcourſes and Worſhip, in all Acts both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, otherwiſe Matters would never be pacified in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinals approved of what they deſired, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to the Pope; who, in a full Congregation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Inquiſition, approved the Cardinals Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout prohibiting in all Acts the maintaining of that Opinion, which gave the People Offence, and taking away the Word <hi>Sanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>cation</hi> out of the Office of the Church. And upon <hi>May</hi> 24. 1622. came forth a Decree, which repeating thoſe of <note place="margin">P. 447.</note> 
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. and <hi>Paul</hi> V. and confirming them, farther command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That for the future, till this Article ſhould be determined by the Apoſtolick Chair, neither in private Diſcourſes, or in Writings, any one ſhould dare to aſſert that the Bleſſed Virgin was conceived in original Sin; nor handle any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Opinion, excepting only thoſe, who were ſpecially privileged herein by the Pope. Alſo his Holineſs command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That ſince the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church celebrates ſolemnly the Feaſt and Office of the Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> That all Perſons Eccleſiaſtical and Secular, and thoſe of every Order, in the holy Sacrifice of the Maſs and other divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices both publick and private, ſhould uſe no other Word but that of <hi>Conception,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Sanctification, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now again the <hi>Immaculiſts,</hi> after this Decree, are tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pann'd into new Rejoicing; the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> in their Convent <note place="margin">P. 450.</note> on the Top of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> for Three Nights together had Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works and Signs of great Triumph, as if they had got the Victory.</p>
                  <p>On the Fourth of <hi>June</hi> 1622. a Brief of the Popes was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſent to the King, ſignifying, after the Commendation <note place="margin">P. 451.</note> of his Piety, how far he had proceeded in this Affair, out of a Deſire to bring ſome Comfort to him and his Kingdoms. But then he adds, in the former canting Strain, <hi>That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he did not determine any thing new at preſent, was the weightineſs of the Affair, and the Example of the Popes his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors: For we, who are placed by God over the Chriſtian World, in the Chair of Chriſtian Wiſdom, ought to hearken to the Voice of the holy Spirit, and not examine the Matter by the Poiſes of humane Reaſons: Wherefore, ſeeing the eternal Wiſdom has not yet diſcovered to the Church the Receſſes of ſo great a Myſtery,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96967:51"/>
the faithful People ought to reſt ſatisfied in the Authority of God and the</hi> Roman <hi>Popes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The King ſent his Letters of Thanks to the Pope, dated <note place="margin">P. 453.</note> 
                     <hi>July</hi> 14. 1622. and in like manner to the Cardinal Inquiſitors; intreating them to uſe the ſame Endeavours in what remained, till his Holineſs would vouchſafe to define the Controverſy. And now all <hi>Spain</hi> ſounded their Gladneſs and erected their Trophies, and nothing but Expreſſions of Joy were ſeen or heard for ſeveral Months together.</p>
                  <p>But all this Joy was interrupted at <hi>Barcenona, Caeſar-Auguſta,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 455.</note> and other Parts of the Kingdom, by reaſon of a Grant the Pope made and which was publickly affixed, according to the Clauſe of the foregoing Conſtitution <hi>(excepting thoſe to whom the Pope ſhould give a ſpecial Indulgence)</hi> wherein he gave this Privilege to the <hi>Dominicans</hi> notwithſtanding the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That <hi>in any of their private Conferences among themſelves, and none elſe, they might freely and lawfully handle the Matter of the Bleſſed Virgins Conception, without incurring the Penalties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſaid Decrees.</hi> Which was dated 22 <hi>July</hi> 1622. This Grant, ſays the Author of the Hiſtory, troubled many who would have had the pious Opinion ſecured and put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Doubt; but he hopes, that thoſe to whom the Pope gave this laſt Indulgence, will not abuſe it, nor break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open Scandals, when the Permiſſion reaches no further, than to private Colloquies.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen the buſy Management of a Four Years Embaſſy, ending juſt where it began; and made a pleaſant Piece of formal Pageantry: Great Charity and Piety pretended by Two Kings, anſwered with Deceit and pious Frauds, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently intended by Two Popes. We have ſeen pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility ſitting in a Chair of State, and ſaying nothing: A fierce Controverſy brought before an unerring Judge, who will let no body determine ſuch Matters without or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf; and when all earneſtly expect how he will end it, he tires them with Delays, or deceives them with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anſwers. In a Word, I verily believe that this Judge of Controverſies, has ſet a foot Ten, for one he has ever decided: For though he calls this laſt his Office, yet he is as hardly brought to this Work, as a Bear is to the Stake; and when he is, he is either fearful of the Conſequents, and dares not ſpeak
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96967:51"/>
out, or ſullen and will not, or crafty and puts it off, and ſays he cannot do it yet, (as in the Caſe before us, which I ſuppoſe he will leave for the day of Judgment to decide) or if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that once in an Age he gives us a Caſt of his Office, as he hath done in this Age, in the Caſe of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Parties might have done as wiſely to have referred the Matter to a Lottery, or the Chance of a Die, as bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtand to this blind Award; for after his Deciſion they find ſuch manifeſt Defects either of Skill or Honeſty, That thoſe who are condemned, ſee no reaſon to retract or alter their Opinion, and oftentimes are ſo bold as to declare and prove him to have been miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>But though the Popes are reſolved not to define the Opinion of the <hi>Immaculiſts</hi> to be <hi>de fide,</hi> yet it is a great Comfort to them, that the Church has ſhewed a greater Propenſion and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this than the contrary. The <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council of Baſil</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Seſſ. 36.</note> ſpake all their Mind, when they determined plainly for it, <hi>That ſhe was free from all Sin original and actual, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that this Opinion ought to be approved, held and embraced of all Catholicks as pious and agreeable to the Churches Worſhip, to the Catholick Faith, right Reaſon and Holy Scripture, and that it ſhall be lawful for none to preach and teach the contrary.</hi> What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Chance was it, that this Decree was not anticipated Three Seſſions; for then their Work might have been effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done? Whereas having in the Thirty fourth Seſſion depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the lawful Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. the <hi>Council</hi> when it held this Seſſion which decreed the immaculate Conception was it ſelf Schiſmatical, and ſo it became invalid, not having the Pope's Confirmation herein. It is a great Comfort to them, <hi>That though</hi> (as a Jeſuit <note n="d" place="margin">Jo. Boniſac. de vit. &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac. Mar. Virg. l. 1. c. 4.</note> ſays) <hi>our Mother the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is dumb</hi> (he means the Pope eſpecially, who is the Churches Mouth) <hi>in this Queſtion, yet with</hi> Zachary <hi>ſhe ſometimes takes the Writing-Tables into her Hands, and does even as good</hi> (tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non) <hi>as ſubſcribe to the Opinion of Divines that contend for it.</hi> Even thoſe <hi>dumb Popes</hi> have made very broad Signs of their Good-will towards it. Witneſs their Approbation of the Feaſt of the <hi>Conception,</hi> which if it had not been without Sin, we are told, <note n="e" place="margin">Raynaudus Dyptic. Mar. p. 135.</note> had not deſerved to be celebrated, being not worthy of Veneration for it ſelf, yea hated by <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> becauſe of the original Stain annexed to it. <hi>Bernardinus de Buſto</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:96967:52"/>
compoſed an Office of the Conception, which the Pope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and gave Indulgences to thoſe that celebrated that Office, as he himſelf tells us, <note n="f" place="margin">Marial. ſer. 3. p. 40.</note> and cites ſeveral Paſſages out of it <note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. p. 51.</note>.

of thine have cryed to Heaven with Groans unutterable, to ſee that Day and could not ſee it; but thy poor Servant has ſeen it, ſeen it indeed, and it has greatly gladded him: But who has ſo ſteelly a Breaſt that will not be ſoftened, <hi>(none, doubtleſs, unleſs it be the hard-hearted Pope, who cannot relent)</hi> when all the World conſpires to aſſert the Innocency of the Virgins Soul, for as to the Integrity of her Body none of the Orthodox ever doubted it?</q>

The Second Revelation or Apparition is this. <q>In the Days of <hi>Charles (no body knows which)</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> there was a Clerk, a Kinſman of his, a great lover of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and one who daily read her <hi>Hours</hi> devoutly, who, by the Advice of his Parents, conſenting to marry with a fair and noble maid, and receiving the nuptial Benediction from a Prieſt, after Maſs was ended, he remembred that he had not read that Day the <hi>Ladies Hours;</hi> wherefore making all go out of the Church, and ſending his Spouſe home, he read the <hi>Lady's Hours</hi> hard by the Altar; and when he repeated that Antiphona, <hi>Thou art fair and comely, O Daughter of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſuddenly the bleſſed Virgin appeared between Two Angels, with Chriſt in her Arms, ſaying to him; If I be ſo fair and comely, wherefore is it that thou leaveſt me, and takeſt another Spouſe? Am not I fairer than ſhe is? Haſt thou ſeen any ſo fair? He made Anſwer, O my Lady, thy Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs excels all the Beauty of the World, thou art elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Quires of Angels, what wouldeſt thou have me to do? She anſwered, if thou wilt forgo thy carnal Spouſe for my Love, thou ſhalt have me for thy Spouſe in the celeſtial Kingdom; and if thou wilt ſolemnly celebrate the Feaſt of my Conception yearly, upon the Sixth of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and preach the Celebration of it, thou ſhalt be crowned with me in the Kingdom of my Son; after which Words, the bleſſed Mother of Chriſt vaniſhed. The Clerk refuſing to return home, became a <hi>Monk</hi> in another Country, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort ſpace of Time, he was made the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legia,</hi> and carefully celebrated the Feaſt of her Conception, and ordained it to be kept yearly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Revelation, is a ſcandalous Story of a Prieſt, <q>a devout Worſhipper of the Virgin, that uſed to ſing her <hi>Hours,</hi> who, after he had been committing Adultery with another Mans Wife, entered into a Veſſel to paſs over the River <hi>Seine,</hi> and as he ſailed, ſung the <hi>Virgin's Hours,</hi> and when he came to theſe Words, <hi>Ave Maria, gratiaplena,</hi> being in the midſt of the River, a company of Devils overturned the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and drowned him, carrying his Soul to Torments. On the Third Day, the bleſſed Virgin with a company of Saints, came to the place where the Devils tormented him, and ſaid to them, <hi>Why do you ſo unjuſtly puniſh the Soul of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:96967:54"/>
They anſwered, <hi>We ought to have him, for he was taken doing our Work.</hi> The Virgin replied, <hi>If they ought to have him, whoſe Work he was imployed in, then he is mine; for when you drowned him, he was ſaying my Mattins, ſo that you are guilty of Injuſtice to me.</hi> When ſhe had ſaid this, the Devils fled away, and ſhe reſtored his Soul to his Body, and taking him by the Arm, commanded the Waters to ſtand as a Wall on the right hand and left, and ſo brought him from the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom ſafe to his Harbour: Who falling down at her Feet, and asking her what Return he ſhould make for her Kindneſs? She deſired him for the future to have a care of committing Adultery, and both to keep himſelf, and exhort others to keep the Feaſt of her Conception upon the eighth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> Upon the ſaying which, he ſaw her aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he led ever after a Hermit's Life, telling what had befel him, and doing as he was commanded.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are alſo told, <note n="c" place="margin">Raynaudus ubi ſupra p. 135.</note> out of the Acts of S. <hi>Oringa (alias Chriſtiana)</hi> who died in <hi>Etruria An.</hi> 1310. how this Feaſt was celebrated in Heaven, being made known to her by a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For ſhe was rapt up in an Ecſtaſy into Heaven, and ſaw the bleſſed Virgin ſitting on a bright Throne by her Son, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moſt precious Garment, with all the Saints rejoicing about her and keeping a ſolemn Feaſt. <hi>Oringa</hi> admiring the Cauſe of all this, and the whiteneſs of the Garment wherein the mother of God ſhone, Chriſt himſelf gave her an account of it, That on that Day they kept in Heaven the Feaſt of her <hi>immaculate Conception,</hi> who remaining a Virgin conceived and bore him who is the true God and Man, and that the whiteneſs of her Garment denoted the Prerogative of her ſingular Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſlender Credit is to be given to theſe Stories of Apparitions and Revelations, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> will tell us; who, it ſeems, himſelf had met with them, and treats them very courſly in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Canons of</hi> Lyons <note n="d" place="margin">Epiſt. 174.</note>. <hi>They produce a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of heavenly Revelation, as they call it: As if any one might not, in like manner produce a Writing, in which the Virgin ſeem'd to command the ſame thing (ſc.</hi> the obſerving a Feaſt) <hi>for her Parents, according to Gods Command ſaying, Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> (Little did he imagine that <hi>Joachim</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> ſhould have had a Feſtival appointed for them, when he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96967:55"/>
wrote this, which was not then thought of) <hi>I am not apt to he moved by ſuch Writings, which are neither back'd with Reaſon nor favoured by certain Authority.</hi> And it's very obſervable that the Credit of this Feaſt decayed in a little time, even here in <hi>England,</hi> where it was firſt obſerved: For in a Council held by <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> Arch-Biſhop, at <hi>Oxford An.</hi> 1222. it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <note n="e" place="margin">Concil. Labbe tom. 11. part. 1. p. 274.</note> 
                     <hi>That all the Feaſts of bleſſed</hi> Mary <hi>ſhould be kept, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Feaſt of the Conception, for the celebrating of which no Neceſſity is impoſed.</hi> In this Council it is left at <hi>Liberty;</hi> and in another Synod, a while after, at <hi>Worceſter An.</hi> 1240. under <hi>Walter de Cantilupo</hi> the Biſhop there, where the Feaſts of his Dioceſs are mentioned, this is left out <note n="f" place="margin">Thiers. ibid. c 20. p. 105.</note>, and the ſame Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod reckoning the Feaſts of the Church of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> does alſo again omit this.</p>
                  <p>The earlieſt time in any other Church, is the Obſervation of it in <hi>France, An.</hi> 1215. in a Decree of <hi>Galo</hi> and <hi>Simon,</hi> Legates of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. related by <hi>Bochellus</hi> 
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 4. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Eccl. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. tit. 9. c. 13.</note> in theſe Words. <hi>This Day the Conception of bleſſed</hi> Mary <hi>is celebrated by the Command of the Apoſtolick Chair.</hi> Which, as <hi>Thiers</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. p. 323.</note>, argues that it was not obſerved in <hi>France</hi> before that Synod, for then it would have only been recited, as other Feaſts there are, without adjoining this ſpecial Admonition.</p>
                  <p>But all this reaches only to ſome particular Churches, not to the univerſal Obſervation of it; for it was oppoſed as an Innovation by many, and great Men. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> is very ſharp againſt it (in the forecited Epiſtle to the <hi>Canons of Lyons.)</hi> 
                     <q>We wonder, ſays he, what ſome of you mean, to bring in a new Solemnity, which the Cuſtom of the Church is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, which Reaſon does not prove, nor ancient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commend. What are we more learned or Devout than the Fathers? We dangerouſly preſume whatſoever in ſuch things their Prudence did paſs by. And if ſo, what reaſon for the Feaſt of the Conception? How, I ſay, can her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be aſſerted to be Holy, which was not of the Holy Ghoſt, not to ſay that it is of Sin; and can it have a Feſtival when it is not Holy? The glorious Virgin will willingly be without this Honour, where either Sin is honoured, or Sanctity ſeems to be falſly brought in. This preſumed No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity will no ways pleaſe her againſt the Cuſtom of the Church; it is the Mother of Temerity, the Siſter of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,

                  <p>The ſame is the Opinion of <hi>Jo. Beleth</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">De divin. Offic. c. 146.</note>, a <hi>Paris</hi> Divine, who ſays, <q>Some have at ſome times celebrated the Feaſt of the <hi>Conception,</hi> and perhaps yet obſerve it; but it is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical nor approved, but rather ſeems to deſerve to be prohibited, for ſhe was conceived in Sin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With whom agrees alſo <hi>Durandus Mimatenſis,</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Concerning the bleſſed Virgin's Nativity, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her Birth; with Remarks thereupon.</head>
                  <p>AS we have hitherto found a great many bold Aſſertions obtruded on us without any cogent Proof; ſo the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt expect the ſame Entertainment ſtill; and it cannot well be otherwiſe, where both Scripture and ancient genuine Authorities are wholly ſilent, as they are in the Things that concern her Nativity. There are indeed Prophecies in the holy Bible concerning her, but not as ſhe is the <hi>Daughter of Anne,</hi> but the <hi>Mother of Jeſus;</hi> not to tell us how ſhe was conceived and born, but that a <hi>Virgin</hi> ſhould conceive, and <hi>the Holy one</hi> ſhould be born of her: Even the Verſes we now have of the pretended <hi>Sibylls,</hi> ſay very little more than that of her.</p>
                  <p>But the Men of this Church cannot be contented and at reſt, till they have filled every Stage of her Life with Wonder and Miracle. So they have done here in her Birth; the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whereof they make as glorious as poſſible may be, and to run parallel in moſt things with thoſe that are related of our Saviour. The oft-cited bold Jeſuit <note n="a" place="margin">Pozae Eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar. l. 2. trac. 6. p. 494.</note> thinks it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to call her (what the Scripture calls the Meſſiah) <hi>The Deſire of all Nations;</hi> but, he adds, <hi>That this Woman was in their Wiſhes before her Son, though he was much more noble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Mankind.</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoiced to ſee the Day of Chriſt, he ſaw it and was glad; but long before</hi> Abraham, Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>rejoiced to ſee the Day of</hi> Mary, <hi>they ſaw it and were glad.</hi> Wherein he is ſeconded by another of his Society, <note n="b" place="margin">J.

                     <note n="f" place="margin">Apparat. ad Annal. n. 40.</note> is contented to tell us in general, <hi>That great Things, and altogether admirable, ſuch as cannot worthily be expreſs'd, did precede the Birth of</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God:</hi> And every one that queſtions this, he brands for a <hi>Man of a narrow Soul, and for one out of his Wits.</hi> And his Reaſon for it is very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Becauſe we know that great and ſtrange Things went before the Birth of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Samuel, Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>John the Baptiſt;</hi> and who <hi>can think ſo abjectly and meanly of God, or be ſo mad as to affirm, That he did greater Things, and was more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to his Servants than to his Mother, to the Friends of the Bridegroom than to his Spouſe?</hi> (Or, if you will, to the <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi> rather than to the <hi>Lady,</hi> for in the Language of another Cardinal <note n="g" place="margin">Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. c. 1.</note>, <hi>Every faithful Soul is a Handmaid of the Virgin; nay more, even the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church it ſelf.)</hi> If the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had been ſpeaking of the Graces that were neceſſary to make her beloved of God, or neceſſary to her Salvation, his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning might have been allowed; but ſpeaking of Gifts (the <hi>gratiae gratis datae,</hi> as the Schools ſpeak) which are meaſured by no Rule, but only the Pleaſure of God, who gives them as he thinks ſit, being at perfect Liberty herein, both as to the Kind and the Degree; it is great Preſumption to argue and reaſon from what has been done for one, to what will be done for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Becauſe God may deny that, for ſecret Reaſons of his own, to one, which he may beſtow upon another: And thus, for Inſtance, he may reſolve to make <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Birth Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous by a Miracle, and to conceal that of the bleſſed Virgin, and therefore work none when ſhe was born. Not that I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that he did not, but that he not having told us that he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96967:60"/>
did, no Man can reaſon (unleſs he were as Wiſe as God, or a Privy-Councellor of Heaven) that God muſt do it, or if he does not, that he is too ſparing where he ought to be more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in his Donations. And I am afraid, upon theſe Principles and Arguings, we ſhall have but a ſorry Account, why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that were but <hi>Servants,</hi> had the Power given, not only of doing the ſame Works that the <hi>Son of God</hi> did, but <hi>greater than thoſe;</hi> which we are ſure is true, becauſe Chriſt foretold it; or why this bleſſed Mother did not work greater Miracles than any of the Apoſtles, which we are ſure ſhe did not, but ought to have had ſuch a Power given her, by the ſaid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> However he was ſo wiſe, as not to mention in particular any Miracle at her Birth, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that none could be produced, unleſs he made uſe of thoſe fabulous Authors to vouch for them, which he had before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded.</p>
                  <p>But we have a Jeſuit <note n="h" place="margin">Poza ib. l. 2. tract. 7. c. 1.</note> to help him out even here alſo, who ſeldom fails at a dead Lift, whoſe Fancy and Invention is ſo pregnant, that he can accommodate any wonderful Story to his Purpoſe: For <hi>Joſephus</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Antiq. 15, cap. 14.</note> mentioning a Tradition, That all the time <hi>Herod</hi>'s <hi>Temple</hi> was a building (which he makes to be about Eight Years) it never rained on the day-time, but all Showers fell by Night, that the Work might not be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; he takes the Story for granted; only what <hi>Joſephus</hi> thought was ordered for the Service of the Temple, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth will have theſe Night-ſhowers to fall in honour of the Virgin, whom he would have to be born at this time; and to give it ſome Colour, heaps up a deal of forced and metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Stuff concerning her, not deſerving to be mentioned.

                  <head type="sub">Remarks on what their Offices and Authors ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bleſſed Virgin's Name.</head>
                  <p>THE whole Diſcourſe of their Authors upon this Subject is made up of Two things, Folly and Profaneneſs. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by childiſh toying with the ſeveral Significations of the Virgin's Name, and ſinding great Myſteries in every Letter of it. Profaneneſs, by attributing thoſe Effects to the pronouncing and uſing of it, which makes it look like a Charm; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ſuch things to her Name, which can only be given to God and our Saviour; as we have ſeen in the foregoing Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and will farther appear in the Sequel of our Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>That there was a Myſtery in our Saviour's Name, and that it was intended to be ſignificative to us, when he was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we are ſure, becauſe the Scripture tells us ſo: And a learned Man <note n="a" place="margin">Rivet. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. pro S. virg. Maria l. 1. c 9.</note> has well obſerved, That as there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there of any Meſſage of an Angel to impoſe this Name of <hi>Mary</hi> on her; ſo if there had been any Myſtery in it, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture would not have been ſilent, in all likelihood, to have declared it. The Name of <hi>Mary</hi> was a common Name at that time among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and many <hi>Maries</hi> are mentioned in the Goſpels; and as now the Names of the Apoſtles and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſons are given to Children, ſo it is probable that the Name of <hi>Mary</hi> was given to many of their Daughters in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Siſter <hi>Miriam,</hi> (for that is the ſame with <hi>Mary.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though there need be no further Inquiry into that, for the impoſing of which we read of no extraordinary Reaſon; yet this will not ſatisfie her <hi>Devoto's:</hi> They examine all the Significations of Hebrew Words from whence it can be derived, and commonly pitch upon that which is moſt improbable. <hi>Jerome Xaverius</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Hiſt. Chriſti perſic. p. 18.</note> will not let his <hi>Indians</hi> be ignorant that her Name has ſeveral Significations; <hi>Maria</hi> is as much as <hi>Alta,</hi> high, (and that indeed is the moſt likely, from the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Here you ſee an Hundred and Fifty Rows of the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> (which being Three in a Row make up Four hundred and Fifty) which muſt be all pattered over, before thoſe few Words that make up the Fifteen Petitions are concluded. There is no Atheiſt or Infidel, who, if he had a Deſign to turn Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into <hi>Ridicule,</hi> could more effectually do it, than by ſuch a Preſcription as this. But we have not the worſt of it yet: For you muſt know, that it is not the Petition and the Sence, following this oft repeated Name that is neceſſary, but the Name alone oft uſed without any thing elſe adjoined is that which they lay much Streſs upon, and which makes accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Devotion with them. For thus I find in that Book of the Jeſuit <hi>P. Barry</hi>

And after ſhe was a Chriſtian, changed this Superſtition into Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obliged herſelf, in gratitude for her Converſion, to pronounce every day as many times <hi>(viz.</hi> a Hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand) the ſacred Names of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now the Devil would come no more to awake her in the morning, her Angel Guardian ſucceeded in that Office; ſo pleaſing to God, ſays the Author, was her Simplicity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. This Worſhip, ſo Japan and unparallell'd, cannot, he ſays, be practiſed, the Number is ſo great, unleſs God give ſome ſpecial Grace: However he adviſes his <hi>Philagie</hi> (ſo he calls the devout Perſon he inſtructs) to chuſe a good round Number of <hi>Maries</hi> to repeat, as a way to get Comfort, and to teſtify the Tenderneſs of his Affections to the Mother of God. Another great Stickler <note n="s" place="margin">Barthol. de los Rios ib. l. 5. cap. 40.</note> for the Advancement of her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preſcribes this Exerciſe as very pleaſing to her, <hi>viz.</hi> The repeating only theſe Two Words, <hi>Ave Maria (Hail</hi> Mary) Seventy two times, in memory of the Seventy two Years of her Life; to which if you adjoin as many Honours and Genuflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Devotion will, he believes, be increaſed, and both Soul and Body be exerciſed in the Service of the bleſſed Virgin. And leſt any one ſhould ſcruple theſe Reverences at the naming of her, which are uſually paid at the mention of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a fam'd <hi>Devoto</hi>

When this Miſer died, and his Works came to be weighed, it was found that his good Works were leſs, and ſo was adjudged to the Devils to be tormented: But the bleſſed Virgin immediately appeared and brought a Loaf of Bread he had given for her ſake, and put it in the Balance, and immediately by her Merits the Scale was turned. She intreated her Son for him, who ſaid, <hi>I was hungry and he gave me no Meat,</hi> &amp;c. He ſhewed no Mercy, therefore deſerves to find none; to whom ſhe replied, <hi>I am the Mother of Mercy and he had me in great Devotion:</hi> And ſo he was releaſed and ſent into the Body again to repent and lead a better Life. Such Stories as theſe have given ſuch Spirit to the Worſhippers of the Virgin, that they are not afraid to diſpute and put it to the Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Name of</hi> Mary <hi>be not more powerful than that of</hi> Jeſus.
